The taxrecipt program recieves the client ID as a command line argument besides the program name, and then obtain the needed information from the database. 
After getting the information from the database, the program prints a recipt with the total donations, and every donation that the client made in 2017.
to build the program, you just type make in the terminal as I have already created the make file that will build the program and create the excutable named taxRecipt.

The recordDonation program recieves 2 pieces of data from the user, which are the user ID and the donation amount the user wishes to make. it then validates the donation 
amount and checks if it is a positive integer or not; if (cin.fail() || Donation_Amount < 0). if the entry is correct, the program will proceed with the transaction. 
Otherwise, the program will keep asking for the correct value. 
Note: to terminate the program, both entries obtained from the user should be '0s'
